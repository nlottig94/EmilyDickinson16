					<h2>About the Project</h2>
					<img alt="Dickinson Development Group" src="img/group.jpg"/>
        
       <p><span class="drop">T</span>his Emily Dickinson Fascicle 16 site was developed by four students at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. Our members were part of the 
           Digital Humanities Fall 2015 class which required an end-of-term project. Our team decided to take on a project which was originally started by Michele Ierardi.
           Her site, <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~ajf2j/emily/stab.html">Translating Emily: Digitally Re-Presenting Fascicle 16</a>, was a daring site which was
           done by Ierardi after completing her PhD coursework. Ierardi worked on the project in the summer of 1997 with her then-fiance-now-husband Adam Ferrari.
           In her original site, Ierardi chose to use JavaScript to show the variants within Dickinson's manuscript. Her JavaScript
           would show one variant which would then slowly change to show a second or third variant.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ierardi presented the project in a paper titled, "Translating Emily: Digitally Representing Dickinson's Poetic Production Using Fascicle 16 as a Test Case," 
                        at The 1997 Society for Literature and Science Annual Conference, Pittsburgh, PA in November 1997. She wished to continue the project and do a much longer
                    PhD dissertation on it at the University of Virginia, but she was discouraged from doing so. Ierardi's most recent project is a novel which is titled from
                    Dickinson's poem 1108. More about this can be read in her blog post, <a href="http://deaddarlings.com/life-death/">Life and Death and the Novel.</a></p>
           
          <p> After finding Ierardi's original site, Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar - our Digital Humanities professor - found that the original JavaScript was broken and contacted
              Ierardi to ask for permission to continue the project on her own site. Dr. Beshero-Bondar adapted the site and made her own 
        version to teach in her English Literature classes. Ierardi was glad to see that her project was seeing new life. However, Beshero-Bondar made the site during a plane flight and it needed several updates and revisions 
        when our class looked at it early in the semester. Her site, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/EmilyDickinson16/1601.html">Emily Dickinson's Fascicle 16: Eleven Poems</a>,
              featured text of Dickinson's original poems and the variants were coded to sit on top of each other. Below,
        images of the poems in printed form could be found to view the differences between the original and the publications. Our class found it confusing and we were unsure of
        the relationship between the images and the text as it had not been explained. The images of published poems were also confusing as the poems were often split on two pages and other
        poems sat above and below them on the page of the book. Thus, the Dickinson Team was formed to combat these issues and to repurpose this site
          once more in our own way.</p>
        
        <p>Our original research question was posed to compare line variations in Dickinson's manuscript and compare them to which version of the lines were chosen when they were
        later published. However, upon starting the project we realized that we should be looking at all of the changes made to each poem. We found out that much more than
        the variants were changed. Dashes were added and subtracted, lines were flipped, capitalization was changed, and much more. For more information about
        how the published poems are read differently from Dickinson's original Fascicle poems, please visit our <a href="http://dickinson16.newtfire.org/conclusion.html">Conclusion page</a>. We also took a look at the usage of dashes
        compared to Dickinson's original poems and the published versions. More information about this can be found in a graph under <a href="http://dickinson16.newtfire.org/dash.html">Dash Usage Comparison.
        </a></p>
       
        <p>Throughout the semester, we learned all of the tools that we would need to make our own Dickinson site. We learned basic XML coding of documents, 
        how to apply XSLT Stylesheets to these documents, make them into HTML pages, use SVG to make graphs, and construct Javascript to go along with the webpages, along with 
        several other skills. We worked hard throughout most of the semester to learn all of these skills and spent the last three weeks of class applying them to our 
        project in real life. For more information on how all of this was done, please visit our <a href="http://dickinson16.newtfire.org/methodology.html">Methodology page.</a></p>
        
        <p>When starting the project, we needed to find a way to display the poems on a webpage that allowed the user to see Dickinson's variants and compare Dickinson's
        poems to the published poems. Our site features buttons on the side of each poem that allow you to click to see which version of the poem you would like to look at.
        Multiple poems can be selected at once and viewed by color to compare side-by-side. This allows you to view Dickinson's original poem next to a published version of 
        the poem. Our site differs from the <a href="http://www.edickinson.org/">Emily Dickinson Archive</a>, which requires that you search for a poem by a specific word or set of words. Once selecting a poem on this site, you
        are brought to a page which focuses on the image of Dickinson's manuscript and you must click on the side to be able to view the text of different published versions. 
        Our site puts both the text and the image side by side and allows you to view the variations whereas their site requires that you click to view the text and Dickinson's
        variations are placed in footnotes below the poem. Our project aimed to find a way to make this easier for the user to view both the manuscript and published versions for side-by-side
        comparison. Our site also takes a close look at one fascicle while the Emily Dickinson Archive lets you view any of her poems.</p>
     
        <p>Our hopes are that this site can provide an insightful look at Dickinson’s Fascicle 16 and offer a user-friendly way to compare the original poems to the published editions and analyze the changes that were made.</p>
